Analysis of Bulgaria's 2016 Presidential election results outside Bulgaria

Voting results data was scraped from the website of the Central Elections Commission of Bulgaria. 

The names of the polling stations appear in Bulgarian using Cyrillic transcription and I translated 
them manually into English in "ballots_english.csv"

File "ballots.csv" contains the final dataset with some calculated statistics such as 
the share of the vote gained by each political candidate.
